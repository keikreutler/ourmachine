Today's Taurus Horoscope from Cafe Astrology:

> Jupiter, the Great Benefic, is coming to the end of its retrograde period and begins its forward journey in direct motion today, Taurus. Intimate matters become clearer and finances move forward with Jupiter's direct motion. If you've been procrastinating on settling your finances, you're now ready to tackle them. Your head clears in terms of your more practical goals. As well, your home life becomes happier, warmer, and more supportive. You regain enthusiasm for projects you may have let go around the house, and for some of you, a family relationship can bud or strengthen. Your motivation to get back on track is returning.

I'm not sure if a Benefic is a typo.

The above sounds right to me; the last months have been stressful and precarious. My stability has been shelved with ever-going movement, rarely having a place to keep my things and no mandated focus. Tasks are picked at, and put down, never *totally* finished. Productivity is not the problem; there's something missing. "Incomplete emotional transactions."

<div class="caption">Ice Station Zebra (1968) is a cold-war era suspense and espionage film directed by John Sturges, starring Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan, Ernest Borgnine, and Jim Brown. The plot has parallels to events reported in news stories from April 1959, concerning a missing experimental Corona satellite capsule (Discoverer II) that inadvertently landed near Spitsbergen, situated in the Arctic Ocean, on April 13, which was believed to have been recovered by Soviet agents.
