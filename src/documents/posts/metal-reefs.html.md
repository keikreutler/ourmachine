Today's Taurus Horoscope from Cafe Astrology:

> Jupiter, the Great Benefic, is coming to the end of its retrograde period and begins its forward journey in direct motion today, Taurus. Intimate matters become clearer and finances move forward with Jupiter's direct motion. If you've been procrastinating on settling your finances, you're now ready to tackle them. Your head clears in terms of your more practical goals. As well, your home life becomes happier, warmer, and more supportive. You regain enthusiasm for projects you may have let go around the house, and for some of you, a family relationship can bud or strengthen. Your motivation to get back on track is returning.

Is Benefic a typo?

<div class="caption">*Ice Station Zebra (1968)* is a cold-war era suspense and espionage film directed by John Sturges, starring Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan, Ernest Borgnine, and Jim Brown. The plot has parallels to events reported in news stories from April 1959, concerning a missing experimental Corona satellite capsule (Discoverer II) that inadvertently landed near Spitsbergen, situated in the Arctic Ocean, on April 13, which was believed to have been recovered by Soviet agents.</div>

We sat outside by the canal and talked about how it's important to have your shit together. I'm not sure if it's just the latest evolution in false consciousness, or a bit closer to the truth, but I'm too preoccupied with (1) crossing things off. From what blood line have I inherited this? Secondly, (2), it's that hard task for an artist to somehow *not absorb everything*.

Where is the spiritual sweat? Give it 100 years.

Yesterday there was an article I read via the Google alert I currently have set up for just the term "satellites."

There's a place just south of New Zealand where they guide unpowered and broken bits of space debris in orbit, the stuff that's too large to burn up upon re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. It sinks to the bottom of the ocean, somewhere scattered alongside other artifacts, including the old Russian space station *Mir*. I'm not sure what could be left of it now, but if things keep being guided toward this hallowed resting ground, eventually the junk will gain enough traction and start to build up. People are speculating about this reef for "archaeologists of the future" to find. There's something unsaid in our venerated imagination of things, our things, in the future that *won't be used*. I hope Jupiter stays out of retrograde forever.
